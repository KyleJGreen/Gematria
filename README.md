Gematria is the a [Qabalistic] method of interpreting the Hebrew scriptures by computing the numerical value of words, based on those of their constituent letters (wikipedia.) This program is written to preform this function on a large scale, taking books from the Torah, and calculating their scores, word by word, paragraph by paragraph, chapter by chapter and book by book. The program also compiles two lists: the words associated with each gematria score and an alphabetical list of all words in the Torah, where they can be found and what their scores are. As of yet, I have only run the script on the book of Genesis.

This project takes a data science approach to a topic that has interested scholars since the days of antiquity. Now, with modern computing power, it is possible not only to analyze the Torah on a word by word basic, but to analyze the overall structure of the Torah and determine if it contains mathematical patterns whose significance exceeds chance. I have no pre-existing hypothesis as to whether or not I believe these patterns do exist, but I believe that IF they do, the key to unlocking them lies in machine learning. For instance, once all of the words in the Torah are converted to words, I can apply a Markov chain to detect the probability of certain numbers following other numbers. Given a high probability in enough instances, this would indicate that the gematria equivalents of the words constitute a language in and of themselves.

Text pulled from https://www.crowndiamond.org for applying Gematria cypher. In order to get the Qabalistic correspondeces, I emailed the author of the site, asking for which Hebrew letters were intended by the English renderings. He sent me a mapping for the letters and stated that he used a 1980's version of MacBible as his source.
