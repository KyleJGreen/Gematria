# Text pulled from https://www.crowndiamond.org for applying Gematria cypher. The html file taken from this site contains a number of idiosyncrasies, such as a footer text and one of the chapters being labeled in Hebrew, instead of English. In order to get the Qabalistic correspondeces, I emailed the author of the site, asking for which Hebrew letters were intended by the English renderings. There are some Hebrew letters that are represented by multiple English letters, some of which are inferred in my mapping and not specifies by the author (the only case specified by the author is 'Ayin': the rest I inferred.) The author used a 1980's version of MacBible as his/her source.
